# Vertically Scrolling Shoot'em-up Movement Snippet
## A demo project featuring 2D shoot'em-up controls, movement animations and a nice, nostalgic CRT shader.  
### [PLAY ON ITCH.IO](https://gizmotep.itch.io/scroller-snippet)  
The project emphasizes clean and modular (decoupled) OOP code.    

### Full-screen CRT shader  
Made with Unity's Shader Graph. This full-screen effect warps the screen, adds a bunch of static, and dynamic scanlines.  
Enhances the "retro" look in general. Much easier to appreciate on the itch.io page, [here](https://gizmotep.itch.io/scroller-snippet)!

### Movement 

Classic 2D shoot'em-up movement with W/A/S/D in 8 directions + animations. Movement code [here](https://github.com/Gizmo-of-Arabia/Vertical-Scroller/blob/main/Vert-Scroller-Shooter/Assets/Scripts/PlayerCharacter/CharacterController.cs).

### Resetting  

This action becomes available when you fly out of bounds. Simple UI feedback done with Scriptable Object events.
